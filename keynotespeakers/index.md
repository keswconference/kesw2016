### **[Axel Polleres](https://ai.wu.ac.at/~polleres/)**, Institute for Information Business, WU Wien, Austria

**Title: (Enterprise) Linked Data: What's missing?**

<img class="keynote-photo" src="/resources/AxelPolleres.jpg"/>

<p class="text-justify"><i>In this talk, I will discuss gaps and challenges to deploy the ideas of Linked Data and the Semantic Web, from an Enterprise point of view. Shifting away from a predominantly academic perspective and an exclusive focus on open data, many of us conceive Linked Data as an emerging key disruptive technology for enterprise data management. Still, various challenges lie ahead to lay the foundations for successful Enterprise Linked Data product and services development.</i></p>
<p class="text-justify"><i>In a current research project, <a href="http://www.linked-data.at/">PROPEL: Propelling the potential of Enterprise Linked Data in Austria</a>, we gauge industry requirements and innovation potentials as well as technology & standards gaps for Linked Data to be effectively usable in enterprises. We'll report on the findings and on potential contributions to fill these gaps from our own research at WU Wien.</i></p>

### **[Filip Železný](http://ida.felk.cvut.cz/zelezny/)**, Department of Computer Science, FEE CTU in Prague, Czech Republic

**Title: Semantic web and machine learning: time to re-sync**

<img class="keynote-photo" src="/resources/FilipZelezny.jpg"/>

<p class="text-justify"><i>In this keynote talk I will review some recent developments due to different authors in the intersection of knowledge representation and semantic web on one hand, and machine learning on the other hand. The talk will address the state of the art in symbolic learning using logical frameworks native to the semantic web community, but it will also cover some interesting results triggered by the statistical and deep-learning stream, such as embedding knowledge bases into tensor or connectionist representations allowing the induction of novel concepts.</i></p>
